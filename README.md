===========

This started as "Just a collection of remote files that I want to keep",
basically a place that I could put little projects because I have lost so many in the past several years.  Since this repo actually transitioned into
a tool to apply for positions with, I think that it is only neccessary that I update it somewhat.  

##Files of note:
* [serverCheckFinal](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/stuffOfNote/serverCheckFinal.sh)
    - This script will run indefinitely, every X minutes it will attempt to ping an array of servers.  If then records the results of the ping and if a server is down notifies the email address listed. 
* [serverCheckRightBeforeFinal](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/stuffOfNote/serverCheckRightBeforeFinal.sh)
    - This is kind of an homage to an idiot mistake that I made some time ago.  Basically for reasons unknown I tend to keep useless code in the script. This is all of the useless code that should be in serverCheckFinal
