===========

This started as "Just a collection of remote files that I want to keep",
basically a place that I could put little projects because I have lost so many in the past several years.  Since this repo actually transitioned into
a tool to apply for positions with, I think that it is only neccessary that I update it somewhat.  

##Files of note:
* [serverCheckFinal](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/stuffOfNote/serverCheckFinal.sh)
    - This script will run indefinitely, every X minutes it will attempt to ping an array of servers.  If then records the results of the ping and if a server is down notifies the email address listed. 
* [serverCheckRightBeforeFinal](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/stuffOfNote/serverCheckRightBeforeFinal.sh)
    - This is kind of an homage to an idiot mistake that I made some time ago.  Basically for reasons unknown I tend to keep useless code in the script. This is all of the useless code that should be in serverCheckFinal
* [zipt](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/stuffOfNote/zipt.rb) 
    - A ruby script which takes two zip codes and an apikey to [zipwise](http://zipwise.com ) and will display the distance between the two zip codes. 
* [csvSplit](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/stuffOfNote/csvSplit.py)
    - A python script that will take large csv files and break them into smaller components which will upload easier
* [btar](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/betterTagApplicationReport)
    - The better tag application report.  A common request is better searchability of tag applications because currently you can only filter by date, not tag name.  This website implements the ability to add that filter and view only tags that you are interested in as well as the ability to select random contacts or random grouping of contacts and a couple of other things as I go along.  You can see it live at [crackbrain](http://crackbra.in/)
