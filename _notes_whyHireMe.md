###[moveup.sh](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/scripts/bash/moveup.sh)
This is basically just a shell script that will move all of 
the files that match a pattern from all subfolders into one
parent folder.  

###[webanize.sh](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/scripts/bash/webanize.sh)
This file will allow the user to pass it a file and then it
will apply formatting to it so that it will be displayed 
correctly when viewed online (styling courtsey of 
[SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/brushes/) )

Additionally it will upload a file description and file location
to a mysql server.  It will finally call a script that syncs
your local content to a remote folder. 

###[resumeBuilder](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/resumeBuilder)
This is just a basic little lamp server that I am building
to help my wife put her resume together.  

###[apiTest.rb](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/scripts/ruby/apiTest.rb)
Since the position that I want to move to uses ruby, I
decided to make a script that interacts with the Infusionsoft
API.  While not all functionality is enabled through the 
script, there is enough there to play with!

###[zipt.rb](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/dangerzone/blob/master/scripts/ruby/zipt.rb)
This uses a webservice called [zipwise](http://www.zipwise.com)
to calculate the distance between two zipcodes.
