Ctl-A
	Moves cursor to beginning of line of text (on the command-line).

Ctl-B
	Backspace (nondestructive).

Ctl-C
	Break. Terminate a foreground job.

Ctl-D
	Log out from a shell (similar to exit).

Ctl-E
	Moves cursor to end of line of text (on the command-line).

Ctl-F
	Moves cursor forward one character position (on the command-line).

Ctl-G
	BEL. On some old-time teletype terminals, this would actually ring a bell. In an xterm it might beep.

Ctl-H
	Rubout (destructive backspace). Erases characters the cursor backs over while backspacing.

Ctl-I
	Horizontal tab.

Ctl-J
	Newline (line feed). In a script, may also be expressed in octal notation -- '\012' or in hexadecimal -- '\x0a'.

Ctl-K
	Vertical tab.
	When typing text on the console or in an xterm window, 
		Ctl-K erases from the character under the cursor to end of line. 
		Within a script, Ctl-K may behave differently

Ctl-L
	Formfeed (clear the terminal screen). In a terminal, this has the same 
	effect as the clear command. When sent to a printer, a Ctl-L causes an 
	advance to end of the paper sheet.

Ctl-M
	Carriage return.

Ctl-N
	Erases a line of text recalled from history buffer [23] (on the command-line).

Ctl-O
	Issues a newline (on the command-line).

Ctl-P
	Recalls last command from history buffer (on the command-line).

Ctl-Q
	Resume (XON).
	This resumes stdin in a terminal.

Ctl-R
	Backwards search for text in history buffer (on the command-line).

Ctl-S
	Suspend (XOFF).
	This freezes stdin in a terminal. (Use Ctl-Q to restore input.)

Ctl-T
	Reverses the position of the character the cursor is on with the 
	previous character (on the command-line).

Ctl-U
	Erase a line of input, from the cursor backward to beginning of line. 
	In some settings, Ctl-U erases the entire line of input, regardless of 
		cursor position.

Ctl-V
	When inputting text, Ctl-V permits inserting control characters. 
	Ctl-V is primarily useful from within a text editor.

Ctl-W
	When typing text on the console or in an xterm window, 
		Ctl-W erases from the character under the cursor backwards to the first 
		instance of whitespace. In some settings, Ctl-W erases backwards to 
		first non-alphanumeric character.

Ctl-X
	In certain word processing programs, Cuts highlighted text and copies to clipboard.

Ctl-Y
	Pastes back text previously erased (with Ctl-U or Ctl-W).

Ctl-Z
	Pauses a foreground job.
