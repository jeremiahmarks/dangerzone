##Commands and important structures

###puts 
displays to screen and inserts a new line
###gets
gets the most recent input the user typed in
###print 
displays to screen and does not put new line
###false
you know, not true
###if/elsif/else/end
I already miss elif, and I am not sure how I feel about end either.
EXAMPLE

    if brackets == 0 && colons == 0
        puts "IsRuby"
    elsif multiline_comments == "=begin" && "=end"
        =begin
        when the else function evaluates before it's variables
         can be set in every case, I hope that it errors when 
         loading it in irb
        The guards of the multiline comment may not be mentioned
         by name when you are between them, or anarchy will reign.
        =end
        puts "IsRuby"
    else
        puts "You guessed it, still ruby!"
    end

    if wants_another_round
        puts "Never gonna give you up!"
        puts "Yep, still ruby!"
        variable_naming_convention = "_"
    end
seriously, I should have probably just written a section about comments.
###Comments
* single line
    - #
        + # This would be a comment
* multiline
    - =start && =end
        + =start
        + All three of these lines would be comments
        + =end

###break
exit the parent loop

###arrays
* creation
    - variableName = ["apple", apple_color, "pie"]
    - variableName = Array.new(7, 'seven of these in one array')

###next
moves to next item in iterable

###hash
seems very similar to python dictionary
* creation
    - via irb(example)

        irb(main):002:0> abc = {
        irb(main):003:1* :a => "a",
        irb(main):004:1* :b => "b"
        irb(main):005:1> }
        => {:a=>"a", :b=>"b"}
        irb(main):006:0> abc[:a]
        => "a"
