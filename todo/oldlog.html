<h1>11 December 2012</h1>
<p> I just updated <a href="./programming/">a programming todo</a>, another todo list for <a href="./house/">my study room</a>, and the start
of my <a href="../notes/">notes folder</a>.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Find a job</dt>
    <dd>I did no searching for today</dd>
  <dt>Figure out PHP Sessions (write a blog post about it?)</dt>
  <dt>Write a [daily coder challenge('dcc') in ((JAVA && PYTHON)] &&  (dcc( php || c ) ||(Combinatorics problem in python)</dt>
  <dt>Sort through old code, find something worth sharing and share it</dt>
  <dt>Take suit in to cleaners</dt>
    <dd>1220: Returned home from drop off</dd>
  <dt>Doctors appointment</dt>
    <dd>Appointment time: 1445</dd>
    <dd><p>Reason: Follow up on ankle and knee. Concerned because of pain induced
    when putting on shoes or on uneven terrain.</p></dd>
    <dd><p>Doctor called at 1345, asked if I could be in at 2pm. Arrived shortly after
    two (That was somewhat expected, due to distance and what I still needed to do 
    to be "presentable".) Doctor suspects bruising to knee and a sprained ankle.
    Perscribed Imaging (will be completed tomorrow) and another week on light duty.
    Doctor noted that this type of injury is the type that attempted exercising to 
    bring it back would likely backfire and cause an increased recovery time.</p>
  <dt>Front Room maintenance</dt>
    <dd>Started and completed FlowTent early.</dd>
    <dd>Began with neem application, completed most of neem application prior to 
    doctor calling, but need to remix and complete maintenance still</dd>
