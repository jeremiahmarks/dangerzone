    <p>In order for me to be successful in a study environment, I need a desk more than
    a simple lap desk. I need a place that I can escape distraction, not be the center of
    attention, and focus on whatever it is that I need. I can wear headphones, but I still
    generally will hear and react to voice. Here are my plans:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear off the desk</li>
      <li>Put all boxes on desktop away, in a near final place</li>
      <li>Put desk against wall with window</li>
      <li>Set up laptop</li>
      <li>Use USB extension/splitters</li>
      <li>Copy important info to harddrive</li>
      <li>Install CentOS, RedHat, and/or other employable operating systems and servers</li>
      <li>Set up Desktop computer as a media streaming monster on the network</li>
      <li>Learn other employable OS's, keep server on desktop, run there too.</li>
      <li>????</li>
      <li>Profit</li>        
    </ul>
