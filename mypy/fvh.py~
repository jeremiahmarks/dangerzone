    This function uses Turtle as a parent function and adds a jump, gohome, and clean home method to the default methods. 
    
    Jump will retract the turtles pen, move it 'distance' units in the direction it is facing, and then put its pen back on the ground.
    
    gohome simply jumps the turtle home
    
    clean home jumps the turtle home and then cleans up his tracks
