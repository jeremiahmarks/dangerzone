       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (e.g., 12/31/99)

       %z     +hhmm numeric timezone (e.g., -0400)

       %:z    +hh:mm numeric timezone (e.g., -04:00)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric  time  zone  with	 :  to necessary precision (e.g., -04,
	      +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date	 pads  numeric	fields	with  zeroes.	The  following
       optional flags may follow '%':

	      - (hyphen) do not pad the field _ (underscore) pad with spaces 0
	      (zero) pad with zeros ^ use upper case if possible #  use	 oppo-
	      site case if possible

       After  any  flags  comes	 an optional field width, as a decimal number;
       then an optional modifier, which is either E to use the locale's alter-
       nate  representations  if available, or O to use the locale's alternate
       numeric symbols if available.

ENVIRONMENT

       TZ     Specifies the timezone, unless overridden by command line param-
	      eters.  If neither is specified, the setting from /etc/localtime
	      is used.
