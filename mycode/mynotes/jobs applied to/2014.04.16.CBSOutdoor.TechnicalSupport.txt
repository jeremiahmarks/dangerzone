Dear Sir or Ma'am,

I am applying for the Technical Support Analyst that you have posted on careerbuilder.com. I believe that I would be an exceptional fit for the position and hope that you will come to the same conclusion after reading my resume and speaking with me. 

Between my history of providing world-class customer support to a wide array of customers, my eagerness to learn new technologies, and my passion to help others with their technological woes I feel that I consistently provide unparalleled customer service experiences to all of my clients. 

I have strong organizational skills and pay attention to detail. Not only can I talk and type I can provide clear and detailed instructions while taking notes that are meaningful and will likely help any other people that encounter a similar issue. 

I have supported Microsoft Windows 95, 98, ME, XP, Vista, and 7, Mac OS X, IOS, and am capable of supporting many flavors of Linux. I have provided support to multiple ISPs, so I have experience with TCP/IP networking support, not to mention currently provide remote support for several part of my family using RDP or VNC. I can troubleshoot an issue to a particular component and, depending on the scope of support, either support the peripheral or point the customer to where their next avenue of support may lie. 

I have fair to advanced knowledge of Microsoft Office as well as many other office suites: iWork, Google Drive, and Libre Office are all products that I am comfortable working within and helping other understand. I also have a fair amount of experience with supporting a myriad of email clients and definitely have a better than most understanding of email as a whole. 

Lastly, while I do have an extensive background in all of the technical requirements that you have, I can also communicate effectively with customers of all backgrounds, deescalate frustrated users, and love providing exceptional customer service. 

If you would like to speak of this position further you can reach me either via phone (602-741-9703) or email (jeremiah@jlmarks.org). I sincerely hope to hear from you. 

Thank you for your time,

Jeremiah Marks
