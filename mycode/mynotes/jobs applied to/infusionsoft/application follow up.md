1) What hours are you available to work Monday - Friday, part-time? *
	I am able to work any hours desired, whichever days needed. 
	One idea for schedule a that I would be very interested in would be the idea of a half-day working as T1 Tech Support and then the other half of the day as an unpaid intern or in training for a role such as Linux Admin, Network Admin, or Java Developer. I believe such a unique arrangement would be mutually beneficial as I am passionate about the roles that those positions fill and am nearly hireable into those roles. 


2) Tell us about a time when you faced a personal challenge and succeeded. How did that impact you? *
	A personal challenge that I faced and succeeded in besting is smoking cessation. I started smoking when I was 15, before I could even drive. While still in high school nearly everyone around me smoked, and that fact became even more pronounced when I joined the military. While I knew it was bad for my health	there was no real desire to quit. It was only after my wife shared her desire for me to quit that the challenge began. 
	Through the support of loved ones and "re-quitting" after starting again I was finally able to stop smoking forever. 
	One definate lesson that this challenge has taught me is the power of persistance. After failing to "stay quit" the first several hundred times if you want to be a nonsmoker there is nothing to do but to quit again.

3) Tell us about a time when you faced a personal challenge but failed. How did that impact you? *
	A huge personal challenge that I have (currently) failed is the completion of my degree. That current failure has impacted me in numerous ways, both positively and negatively. 
	* I was financing school using loans. Currently I am going no further into debt and am repaying the debt that I incurred. 
	* I have the time and energy to pursue the technologies and topics that interest me. As a bonus: most of these topics will make continuing my degree easier when I return to school.
	* Many positions that I desire are searching for an employee with either a degree or experience that I am unlikely to have short of getting one of those same positions.
	* There is a definite impact to my earnings potential both short term and long term. 



4) Tell us about a time when you did more than was required at your job. *
	My favorite call that I can recall as a senior advisor for iPhone was from a customer who was working with a distributed group of people to send an iPod full of music to one of their group who had recently begun chemotherapy. During the call I was able to consult with my local leadership and the office of the CEO to provide their friend with a remote controlled speaker/charger set that enabled them to listen to the playlists that their friends had put together for them. While something like that is nothing when compared to chemo, I feel that it helped the customer while increasing brand loyalty.

6) If money was of no object, what would your dream job be? *
	My dream job would be a combination of: designing, installing, and configuring solutions to technical issues that people are having; learning new concepts including hardware, software, languages, or protocol (either self-directed or in formal learning environments); and supporting those concepts when they do not work as a user expects.
