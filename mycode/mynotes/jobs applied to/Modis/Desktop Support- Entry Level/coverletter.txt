Good afternoon (again!) Ms. Verderbar! My name is Jeremiah Marks and I am very interested in the Desktop Support position that you have listed at http://www.modis.com/job-seekers/it-jobs/desktop-support-entry-level/39126815/j/ . I believe that this position would leverage several of my strengths to provide me with areas that I am interested in growing in.

I have both breadth and depth when it comes to using ticketing systems, email, chat, and phone in order to provide fast, friendly, and accurate support to a wide array of users on both hardware and software. I would like to leverage that background and experience in order to expand my experience with Active Directory and Microsoft Deployment tools.

I have provided first level phone support for several different technologies and understand the need for quick on their feet, approachable, and accurate people in this role and believe that I may be a great fit.

If you would like to discuss this more, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you,

JL Marks
