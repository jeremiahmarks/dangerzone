Good afternoon Ms. Verderbar. My name is Jeremiah Marks and I am interested in the position that you have listed http://www.modis.com/job-seekers/it-jobs/app-support-phone-support-needed-immediately/39353938/j/ . I believe that I am an excellent fit for this position for several reasons: the "Key Areas of Responsibility" section of the job posting describes several positions that I have historically done very well in; I am passionate about providing top-notch customer service; and the skills that I do not already have are skills that I am excited to develop.

Spectacular customer service is a skill that was taught to me early and reiterated often. Whether it be to an internal customer or an external customer I've always found that providing a positive experience dealing with issues that affect customers makes everybody's day go by smoother.

The overarching passion that I have for customer service means that I hate to leave a customer without a timely and effective solution. This, coupled with my analytical mindset, willingness to explore complex issues, and all cards face up on the table approach to setting expectations propels my customer satisfaction well to the front of my peers.

As I mentioned in the introduction there are some skills that you are looking for that I simply do not have (but given the opportunity I would be very happy to quickly develop them!)

    1. While I am very comfortable with all parts of MS Office, Windows workstations, networking, and client-server architecture I only have some basic troubleshooting experience with Windows Server and minimal exposure to administrating AD.

    2. I have never worked in Healthcare so I am lacking that exposure.

These are areas of potential growth that I would be excited to develop, I simply have not had the opportunity yet.

Thank you for your time! If you would like to talk about my potential suitability for this position, please feel free to contact me at any time.
