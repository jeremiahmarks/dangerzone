Good Morning, Afternoon, or Evening Mr. Lasky!

I was very excited to receive your email regarding the position you are currently looking to fill in the Amazon Consumables group. After seeing the release of the Amazon Dash a couple of days ago I became very interested in what Amazon Fresh is up to. The opportunity to help bring the next generation of shopping to fruition while expanding my own abilities and value as a coder is very, __VERY__ intriguing to me.

I am a passionate coder who really enjoys developing solutions in such a way that I learn something new. Whether it be a new data structure, software package, or approach to solving a problem, figuring out something new is one of my favorite things about coding. I honestly feel that my passion for learning new information, methodologies, and approaches to all aspects of coding will make me an ideal candidate for the team you are assembling. 

Python is my go-to language because it was the first language I learned, the interactive command prompt allows me to quickly test and evaluate different approaches, and it has a wide array of available modules and packages that are easy to install and explore. While using Python as a crutch has left me weak in the more traditional languages, such as Java or C++, I have found that I can adapt quickly to new languages. 

From the interview problems it seems that a large portion of the work will involve Java. I have taken two university classes in Java, CSE 110 and 205 from Arizona State University. Both of those classes I scored an A+ in, largely due to the fact that the classes were simply rehashing material I had already taught myself in Python. My last Java class was Fall of 2011 and I am sad to say that I have not used Java with any regularity since then. I feel entirely certain that the syntax and data structures I learned will come back after a short time of using it, however I do have some catching up to do to be competent again with Java. 

I have dabbled in MySQL, mostly in conjunction with PHP or Python, however I recently wrote a Bash script(http://portfolio.jlmarks.org/mybash/Webanize/) that connects to a remote MySQL server and inserts data into a table when I finish writing a script. I have a very basic understanding of table manipulation, but currently no real understanding of table optimization.

I am continually looking for some new to way to increase my overall coding value. I recently read the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide(http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) as well as Pro Git(http://git-scm.com/book) and have been practicing the lessons learned in those books every chance I can either get or make up.

Here are several pages/sites that I currently have available for your further perusal:

* My portfolio (http://portfolio.jlmarks.org) -- I infrequently added stuff to this page for a very long time. It is mostly python modules that do little odds and ends, however since I recently automated the upload/add to database/make the source code pretty process ( http://til.la/e ) I am adding more frequently.
* My unofficial transcripts (http://transcripts.jlmarks.org) -- I have not completed my degree yet, however if you would like to see what classes I have already taken and the grades in those classes you can see them. Alternatively, if you would care to see the classes and grades in a spreadsheet format rather than pdf, you can also view them on Google Drive (http://til.la/f)
* My resume (http://resume.jlmarks.org) -- I am attaching a copy of my pdf, however it is online as well.
* My contact page (http://contact.jlmarks.org) -- If you would care to find me on various social media sites or see code I have shared on GitHub or Snipplr, you can find it here.

Mr. Lasky, you have no idea how excited I would be to work on a project with Amazon. I sincerely hope to hear back from you soon. 

Thank you!
