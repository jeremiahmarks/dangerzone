Dear Sir or Ma'am,

I am applying for the Technical Support Engineer 1 position that you have listed on http://careers.concentrix.com. I believe that my array of technical skills, history of providing exceptional customer service to customers of all technical levels, and passion for continually pushing myself to expand my technical horizons will enable me to be a valuable asset in this position.

While providing technical support in the past I have learned that one of the most important skills that you can use in a support position is the ability to actively listen to a user, asking probing questions as needed and ensuring that they are given the opportunity to be heard. I pride myself on my exceptional listening skills as well as knowing when to be quiet and let the customer explain their issue. 

Another skill that is very important is the ability to communicate potentially complex ideas clearly, whether it be through spoken word, verbally, or even the occasional hand-drawn image. I have the most experience providing support verbally, however I can make myself clear and understood via the written word as well. 

I have provided support for Microsoft Windows 95, 98, ME, XP, Vista, and 7, Mac OS X, IOS, and am capable of supporting many flavors of Linux. The vast majority of my recent remote client experience involves SSH, VNC, and RDP from various Linux based machines, however I can quickly learn any additional Windows based remote access clients. 

I provide support, both onsite and remotely, to a wide swath of my family for all of their software, hardware and networking issues. I can troubleshoot and repair all ATX based workstations and servers, and believe would welcome the opportunity to do the same for other technologies. 

I am very comfortable with Python scripting and have recently finished reading the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide. While I have limited experience with PERL, it is a language that I would be happy to quickly learn. 

I have a fair amount of experience with consumer grade networking devices to the point that I have installed custom firmware (dd-wrt) on several routers and have recently started to experiment with various bridging protocols. I have some experience with iptables (a common Linux software firewall) and am currently set up in such a manner that I can access several different services on several different machines on my network remotely using port forwarding. 

I have built a great understanding of SMTP, DNS, FTP, and SSH, as well a moderate understanding of TCP/IP. I have done this by running a LAMP web-server on my home network (while my ISP blocks port 80 by default, you can access the very basic website at http://brilliantjenny.com:51630/, the completely unmodified tomcat server at http://brilliantjenny.com:43006/, and a shell prompt at https://brilliantjenny.com:38653/ ), running FTP and SSH daemons on all of my machines, and providing support for POP/IMAP and SMTP in several prior positions. In addition to this I also manage several domains that are either hosted with hosting companies or at friend and relatives houses. 

I sincerely hope that my background and skill set are seen as a perfect fit for the position you are filling. Please don't hesitate to contact me if there are any questions or concerns I can address. I can be reached either via phone (602-741-9703) or email (Jeremiah@JLMarks.org).

Thank you.
