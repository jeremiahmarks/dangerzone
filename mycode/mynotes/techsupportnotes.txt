curret situation:

	when attempting to boot boot fails and displays screen that states : 
		"ALERT! ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/asdfasdf   does not exist. Dropping to shell"

What I have done so far:
	formatted all disks on computer and reinstalled OS

Now:
	working from http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-laptop-and-netbook-25/alert-dev-disk-by-uuid-does-not-exist-ubuntu-1-1-10-2-1ubuntu7-please-help-718554/#post3506207

	rebooted from livecd (actually livesd)
	ran lsblk and got outputof uuids. 
	mounted actual install
	opened fstab
	uuids in fstab are same uuids listed in ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/




    ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/

    rebooting

    same error, note, it is uuid 32b3bb48-73b9-44fa-971b-dd0a5db82d49 that is causing the issues. 

    reboot, attempted to remove other drive from bios, unable to, however was able to move other drive to higher boot priority (it should be blank, so I am interested to see what happens)

    Also disabled quickboot

    rebooted

    same issue

    attempted modified version of this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2017580&p=12078319#post12078319

	    booted to grub
	    changed all mentions of 32b3bb48-73b9-44fa-971b-dd0a5db82d49 to /dev/sdb1
	    similar issue, states that /dev/sdb1 does not exist.

		waited for time (approx45 seconds), entered "exit", 
		success, able to boot into ubuntu.

	reboot, same issue (wait, type exit, good to go. )
