tab autocompletion is awesome also. 

ls 			list the contents of the current directory
ls -la		list ALL the contents of the current directory (includes hidden files and makes it prettier)
cd			change the current directory
| 			this is called "pipe", it moves output from the left to the right
rm			remove/delete
rmdir		remove/delete a directory
cat file 	prints the contents of file to the screen
less		provides a way to scroll through large amounts of output. very helpful with the pipe
pwd			"print working directory", basically tell you where you are
.			indicates the current directory
..			indicates the directory above
top			like process manager in windows
mkdir		make directory
cp			copy
mv 			move
touch		create file
>>			similar to pipe, but it appends the output from the left of the character to the file specified on the right
chmod		change file permissions
chown		change file ownership
ifconfig	very much like ipconfig on windows
wget		download
scp			secure copy
dd 			powerfile disk copy utility
